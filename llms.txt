# vizid

The goal of *vizid* is to make it easy to visualize infectious-disease
data in `R`, particularly data obtained from the [International
Infectious Disease Data Archive
(IIDDA)](https://github.com/canmod/iidda). It provides tools for
transforming data frames so they carry the metadata needed to visualize
themselves.

The package is pre-alpha – we are documenting our [design
ideas](https://canmod.github.io/vizid/articles/design.html) as we
develop it.

## Installation

You can install the development version of vizid from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("canmod/vizid")
```
